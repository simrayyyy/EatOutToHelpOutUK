The Eat Out To Help Out Scheme has now ended (31 Aug 2020)

# EatOutToHelpOutUK
This repo will help people in the UK visualize the Food and Beverage outlets near them participating in the scheme!


## Introduction
This "Eat Out To Help Out" scheme is only available in the UK (England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland) from **3-31 August 2020 on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays at any time of the day**, allowing consumers to dine-in at participating restaurants for **50% off all food and non-alcoholic drinks with a Â£10 cap per person** and can be used for unlimited occassions during the aforementioned periods! This is a move by the government to help the Food and Beverage Industry in the UK. More information on this scheme can be found at: https://www.gov.uk/guidance/get-a-discount-with-the-eat-out-to-help-out-scheme!

My friend Jonathan (https://github.com/pbbpwns) and I have been working on this project (using python) to extract the "Name" and "Address" of restaurants participating in the scheme based on information obtained from https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/eat-out-to-help-out/find-a-restaurant after inputting any post code in the UK, showing up to 100 places based on increasing distance from the post code. 

## How can this project help you?
By following the step-by-step instructions (you will need a python processing platform), this can help you to:
1) Save information from the website after putting in your post code in a .csv format
2) Create a Google Map layer and importing it so you can visualize the eateries involved!

This is pretty much both our first programming project and we hope that during this short duration, this will serve to be useful and convenient for people who want to visualize where the participating restaurants near them are located at. We are very excited to be sharing this with the wider community it is without a doubt that there is always a room for improvement in the code itself and what we have might not be efficient... but it works! As beginners, we are happy that it works to serve a purpose, although we would like to improve on it further and welcome any additional improvements.

## Problems faced to to be solved for future work
In the past day (started on 3 Aug), we have only managed to import these information as a layer in Google Maps, which provides decent visualization on Google Maps. Unfortunately, it seems that we are unable to find a way to link the locations to the official Google Map Business Page directly. We feel that this can be solved but we are still looking at ways to improve both the code and implementation in Google Maps. Please do provide your constructive feedback / comments to improve this community project!
